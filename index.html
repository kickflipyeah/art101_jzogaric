		<div id="intro">

				<p>Hello! My name is Jessica Zogaric and I'm a third year at UC Santa Cruz. I am an Art and Design: Games and Playable Media major and I enjoy painting, playing video games, observing nature, and styling clothing. This site will serve to display all of my labs for ART 101 throughout this quarter! I spend most of my time hanging out with friends or working downtown. Something I spend a lot of time researching and admiring is insects and arachnids. I absolutely love insect themed decor, jewelery, clothing, and more! My favorite part about learning the science of different insects and arachnids is just how unique and alien-like the life cycle and habits of these creatures is. For example, although large, many moths including the Atlas Moth only live up to 7 days in their adult form because they lack mouths for eating. These animals must consume a lifetime's worth of nutrients while they pupate so that they can sustain a life in their adult form without a way of intaking energy. Facts like these make me more interested in the mysterious lives of these creatures. My favorite insect at the moment happens to also be the Atlas Moth due to their large beautiful wings that have small see-through windows.

			<p>Kirby[a] is an action-platform video game series developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo. The series centers around the adventures of a pink hero named Kirby as he fights to protect and save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are side-scrolling platformers with puzzle-solving and beat 'em up elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he inhales certain enemies, he can gain the powers or properties of that enemy manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with action games, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.</p>
