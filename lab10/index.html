        <p>The subject of this lab is focused on coding JavaScript events for webpages such as click, and button. </p>
        <h1 class = "h1">Challenges or Issues:</h1>
        <p>For this lab I had issues with the sorting the new events. I didn't know how to use them and had to reread the class notes many times. I also kept having syntax errors that I didn't notice.</p>
        <h1 class = "h1">My Results:</h1>
        <p>The results of this lab are linked in my script output!</p>
