        <p class = "p">The subject of this lab is focused on JavaScript libraries, more specifically jQuery which can help us code must faster with JavaScript. </p>
        <h1 class = "h1">Challenges or Issues:</h1>
        <p class = "p">For this lab I had issues with understanding the instructions. I didn't realize that I was supposed to change the css with the button so I was trying to make text pop up when the button was pressed. Other than that I had a few minor syntax error; my buttons worked soon after that. </p>
        <h1 class = "h1">My Results:</h1>
        <p class = "p">The results of this lab are my buttons! </p>
