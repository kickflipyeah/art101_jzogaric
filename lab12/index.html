        <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <p>The subject of this lab is focused on JavaScript Conditionals.</p>
        <h1>Challenges or Issues: </h1>
        <p>For this lab I surprisingly had almost no issues with this lab. The only error I had was one of my curly brackets being missing. I was able to do the coding very quickly for this assignment.</p>
        <h1>My Results:</h1>
        <p>The result of this lab is the Harry Potter House Sorter Below!</p>
        <div class = "input-output">
          <h1>Hello there! Welcome to Hogwarts!</h1>
          <p>Please enter your full name into the sorting input to be assigned a house.
          <input type="text"  id="input">
          <button id="button">Submit</button>
          <h3>Your House Output!</h3>
          <div id ="output"></div>
