        <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
        <p>The subject of this lab is focused on JavaScript Loop.</p>
        <h1>Challenges or Issues: </h1>
        <p>For this lab I had many issues with the instructions. I did not understand them in the slightest. Also, I kept having problems with my syntax. It is hard for me to see errors with JavaScript. My loop was not working and I could not figure out why.</p>
        <h1>My Results:</h1>
        <p>The result of this lab is the string list in my output.</p>
