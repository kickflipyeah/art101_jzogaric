  <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
  <p>The subject of this lab is focused on debugging past labs for this class. </p>
  <h1>Challenges or Issues:</h1>
  <p>For this lab I had no issues. With the help of my partner, I was able to quickly find the issue and debug my code.</p>
  <h1>My Results:</h1>
  <p>The results of this lab are show in my "Debugging" header!</p>

  <p>These are my debugging screenshots for lab 11. With this lab, we were tasked to make three buttons in each of our paragraphs that change the CSS for each p tag. When I initially did this lab, I didn't bother to make individual buttons for each "p" tag, so each of the buttons had the same functionality. To fix this, I created unique "p" tags and unique button tags. After this, my buttons can function individually.</p>
