		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer:</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab is focused on the organization of local files. The main goal is making it easier for us as students to conveniently view each of our labs on a neat and organized website. The lab also aims to help us create new index files for each lab so that we can add our work to the individual website pages and access them quickly. </p>
		<h1>Challenges or Issues:</h1>
		<p>For this lab I didn't have much trouble with the organize of files as a whole; despite this, I did face some issues with coding my personal website that hold the lab links. For example, I faced issues with formatting for my images that I added. I ended up doing a process of trial and error with different CSS coding options.</p>
		<h1>My Results:</h1>
		<p>The results of my work for this lab are my mainly finished index.html website that is now up for viewing. It took me a while to get my website to look up to my standards. Althought the website is still very plain, I think it's a great foundation to keep improving upon as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Another result is my file structure in atom which I have displayed below. It's easier to show through atom because I can expand all of the files.</p>
