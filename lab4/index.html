		<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving:</h1>
		<p>The subject of this lab focues on Pseudocoding different tasks. The first thing we psuedocoded was how to wash dishes in a restaurant appropriate way. Then we psuedocoded how to code a health bar as our computer based task. </p>
		<h1>Challenges or Issues:</h1>
		<p>I was somewhat confused about how the JavaScript author block functioned. I was worried that the authorblock had an actual functionality other than just labeling the JavaScript file. </p>
		<h1>My Results:</h1>
		<p>For our lab 4 results, we had a well formatted JavaScript Pseudocode description </p>

		<pre><code>
			/*

				//Make an array of GameObjects with an attached sprite image
				//Divide canvas into the area you want the heart sprites
				    //division would be healtharea = (canvas height)/6 (canvaswidth)/3

				//Divide that area further into the number of sprites
				    //increment = healtharea/numberofhearts

				//Space each element of the array incrementally across the screen according to your divisions
				    //foreach element of the array:
				    //element.position = healtharea + (increment * element index+1)
