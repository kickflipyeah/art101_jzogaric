        <h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
        <p>The subject of this lab is focused working with functions in JavaScript. </p>
        <h1>Challenges or Issues:</h1>
        <p>For this lab I had issues with the JavaScript syntax. I accidentally closed my parenthesis at the bottom of my code, and I didn't catch it for a while. Once I fixed this, I had no issues. </p>
        <h1>My Results:</h1>
        <p>The results of this lab are the JavaScript output that I have embedded below!</p>
