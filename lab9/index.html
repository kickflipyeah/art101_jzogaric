        <h1 class = "h1">Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
        <p>The subject of this lab is focused on coding JavaScript for webpages.For example, the use of getelementbyID() and apendChild() . </p>
        <h1 class = "h1">Challenges or Issues:</h1>
        <p>For this lab I had issues deciding if I should use getelementbyID or getElementsByClassName, because the instructions referenced the prior but my HTML code that I reuse called for the latter. I decided to stick with my code and use getElementsByClassName. This meant that I had to make sure my headers were part of defined classes, and specify which header number [0] I was changing.</p>
        <h1 class = "h1">My Results:</h1>
